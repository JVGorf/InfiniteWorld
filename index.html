            Proof of concept: An infinite "world" in a browser. Think of this as a 2D top-down map. Each character is a "tile" so instead of seeing a grass tile, water tile, farm tile, tree tile, etc... you see letters. Kind of like the OG Dwarf Fortress map, except this map is infinite. Go ahead, stick a weight on a WASD or arrow key and see how far it goes.
